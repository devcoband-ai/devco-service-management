The platform is the integration layer, not CLI tools stitched with cron.\n\nNeeds:\n- Export/download for work products (EPUB, PDF, markdown bundles)\n- Share mechanism (generate links, push to Drive, or direct download)\n- Cross-account artifact access without Gmail as middleman\n- Book distribution workflow built into platform\n- Any other workflows currently dependent on email",

Patterns need to be exportable, shareable, and mergeable — the sharing/export feature should be designed with pattern distribution as the primary driver. Export a pattern as a self-contained package (schema + conops + use cases + assumptions). That IS the share mechanism.",
